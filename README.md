# Welcome to Bubble Coding!

Welcome to my GitHub Page! I am Rover or Bubble whatever you like. I am a Game Developer and Creative Technologist.

I use my GitHub to store all the work(Or most of it) I have done over the years during my Bachelors, for fun and now during my Masters in Game Studies and Engineering, <br/>

There are two major repostories. The Creative Technology repo where almost everything I did during my Bachelors can be found.
The second one is Game Studies and Engineering here I place everything I do for my masters, but also all my side project that have something to do with my masters.<br/>
